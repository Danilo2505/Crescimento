Boron Human Clinicals
Project: Boron

Overview

Boron is a trace mineral that has garnered significant interest in the health and wellness community for its potential benefits on bone health, hormone regulation, and cognitive function. While it is not an essential nutrient for human life, research suggests it plays a supportive role in various physiological processes.

This project page serves as a central hub for all human clinical trials and scientific research related to boron supplementation. Our goal is to provide an unbiased, evidence-based overview of its effects, mechanisms, and safety profile.

Key Areas of Research

*   Bone Health and Metabolism: Boron appears to play a crucial role in bone development and maintenance, potentially enhancing the utilization of calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D.
*   Hormone Regulation: Studies have investigated its impact on raising levels of free testosterone and estrogen, particularly in cases of deficiency or micro-nutrient insufficiency.
*   Cognitive Performance: Some research indicates that boron supplementation may improve cognitive function, including attention, short-term memory, and hand-eye coordination.
*   Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Boron may influence inflammatory pathways, such as reducing levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and other inflammatory biomarkers.
*   Mineral Metabolism: It is involved in the metabolism of key minerals and energy substrates.

Mechanism of Action

The exact mechanisms of boron are still being elucidated, but it is believed to function primarily by:
*   Influencing the activity of specific enzymes.
*   Modulating the response of certain hormones (e.g., parathyroid hormone, vitamin D).
*   Affecting the cell membrane and its signaling pathways.

Dosage in Clinical Studies

Typical dosages used in human clinical trials range from 3 mg to 10 mg per day. Higher doses have been studied but are less common. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

Safety and Side Effects

Boron is generally well-tolerated at recommended dosages. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults is set at 20 mg per day. Excessive intake can lead to toxicity, with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and skin inflammation.

Conclusion

Boron is a promising micronutrient with several potential health benefits supported by emerging human clinical data. However, more extensive research is needed to fully understand its optimal uses and long-term effects.
